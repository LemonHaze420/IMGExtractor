# IMGExtractor
Extracts IMG files found within What's Shenmue. 

The file format is only seen in What's Shenmue builds and is never seen in any of the currently released builds of Shenmue I/II. It is a simple format which stores raw data in an IMG file, with a matching IDX file which stores metadata about the files contained within the IMG file.

`.\IMGExtractor.exe <path to IMG> <output directory>`
